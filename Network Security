## 4.0 Network Security (20% of the exam)

### 4.1 Common Security Concepts

#### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can access data.  
- **Integrity:** Data cannot be changed or tampered with.  
- **Availability:** Systems and data are accessible when needed.

#### Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
- **Authentication** — verifies identity (passwords, tokens, biometrics).  
- **Authorization** — defines what actions the user can perform.  
- **Accounting** — tracks user activity and resource usage.

#### Least Privilege
- Users should have only the minimum rights required to perform their tasks.  
- Reduces risk of accidental or malicious damage.

#### Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers protect assets: physical, network, host, application, and data.

#### Implicit Deny
- Default rule in security: deny all unless explicitly allowed.

#### Zero Trust
- Never trust; always verify.  
- Authenticate and authorize every request, even inside the network.

#### Separation of Duties
- Split critical tasks between different people to prevent abuse.

#### Change Management and Configuration Management
- Ensure all network changes are documented, tested, and approved.
- Use version control for configuration files.

#### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
- Defines proper use of company systems and network.
- Prevents legal and security issues.

#### BYOD and Guest Networks
- Segregate personal and guest devices from internal resources.
- Use VLANs and captive portals.

### 4.2 Physical Security

#### Access Control
- **Badge Readers:** track entry and exit.  
- **Biometric Scanners:** fingerprint, retina, or facial recognition.  
- **Mantraps:** prevent tailgating.  
- **Locks and Keypads:** restrict access to server rooms.

#### Environmental Controls
- Maintain proper temperature and humidity (HVAC).  
- Use fire suppression (gas, water, or chemical).  
- Install surge protectors and grounding.

#### Surveillance
- **CCTV systems** monitor physical locations.  
- Recordings stored securely for forensic analysis.

#### Fencing and Security Guards
- Physical deterrence and first layer of defense.

#### Cable Locks and Secure Cabinets
- Prevent hardware theft in public or shared spaces.

### 4.3 Secure Network Design

#### Network Segmentation
- Divide network into logical zones using **VLANs** and **subnets**.
- Limit broadcast domains and contain breaches.
- Typical segmentation:
  - User VLAN
  - Server VLAN
  - Management VLAN
  - Guest VLAN
  - Voice VLAN

#### DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
- Isolated zone between internal and external networks.
- Hosts public-facing servers (web, email, DNS).
- Limits exposure if compromised.

#### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Encrypts traffic between remote devices and private networks.
- Common types:
  - **Site-to-Site (IPsec)** — connects entire networks.
  - **Client-to-Site (SSL/TLS)** — connects individual users.

#### VLAN Tagging
- Uses **802.1Q** tags to identify VLAN traffic between switches.
- Prevent VLAN hopping attacks by disabling unused ports and enforcing trunk configurations.

#### NAC (Network Access Control)
- Evaluates device health before granting access.
- Checks antivirus, patches, and configurations.
- Quarantines non-compliant devices.

#### Air Gaps
- Physically isolated network with no connection to others.
- Used for critical or classified systems.

#### Network Zones
- Define trust boundaries:
  - **Internal network**
  - **DMZ**
  - **External/public network**

#### East-West vs North-South Traffic
- **North-South:** between internal and external networks.  
- **East-West:** between systems inside the same data center or LAN.  
- East-West traffic requires microsegmentation and internal firewalls.

### 4.4 Secure Protocols

#### Web Protocols
- **HTTPS (TCP 443):** HTTP over TLS; encrypts browser traffic.  
- **HTTP (TCP 80):** insecure; avoid in production.  
- **HTTP/2, HTTP/3:** improve performance and security.

#### Remote Access
- **SSH (TCP 22):** secure remote administration.  
- **Telnet (TCP 23):** unencrypted; deprecated.  
- **RDP (TCP 3389):** encrypted remote desktop for Windows.  
- **VNC (TCP 5900):** graphical desktop sharing (add encryption).

#### File Transfer
- **SFTP (TCP 22):** uses SSH for encryption.  
- **FTPS (TCP 989/990):** FTP over SSL/TLS.  
- **TFTP (UDP 69):** no authentication; for firmware or boot files.  
- **SMB (TCP 445):** file sharing in Windows; secure with SMBv3.  
- **NFS (TCP 2049):** file sharing in Unix/Linux.

#### Email Security
- **SMTP (TCP 25)** — outgoing mail.  
- **POP3 (TCP 110)** and **IMAP (TCP 143)** — incoming mail.  
- Secure versions:
  - **SMTPS (465)**, **POP3S (995)**, **IMAPS (993)**.  
- **SPF, DKIM, DMARC** — protect against spoofing and phishing.

#### Directory and Authentication
- **LDAP (TCP 389)** — directory queries.  
- **LDAPS (TCP 636)** — LDAP over SSL/TLS.  
- **Kerberos (TCP/UDP 88)** — ticket-based authentication.  
- **RADIUS (UDP 1812/1813)** — AAA protocol for VPNs, Wi-Fi, etc.  
- **TACACS+ (TCP 49)** — Cisco AAA protocol, encrypts full payload.

#### Time and Sync
- **NTP (UDP 123):** synchronize device clocks; essential for logs and certificates.  
- Secure it with authentication or internal NTP sources.

#### Network Management
- **SNMPv3:** secure management with encryption and authentication.  
- Disable SNMPv1/v2c.

### 4.5 Wireless Security

#### Encryption Standards
- **WEP:** deprecated; static keys; easily broken.  
- **WPA:** RC4 + TKIP; better but obsolete.  
- **WPA2:** AES + CCMP; industry standard.  
- **WPA3:** SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals); current standard.

#### Authentication Methods
- **Open:** no security.  
- **PSK (Pre-Shared Key):** shared password.  
- **Enterprise (802.1X):** uses RADIUS for authentication.

#### EAP Types
- **EAP-TLS:** certificate-based; most secure.  
- **EAP-TTLS:** tunneled TLS; easier deployment.  
- **PEAP:** commonly used with Active Directory.  
- **LEAP:** Cisco proprietary; not secure.

#### Captive Portals
- Used for guest access (hotels, cafes).
- Require acceptance of terms before access.

#### WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
- Simplifies setup but insecure (PIN brute-force).
- Disable in enterprise environments.

#### Rogue Access Points
- Unauthorized APs create backdoors into the network.
- Detect using WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System).

#### Evil Twin
- Malicious AP mimicking legitimate SSID.
- Used for credential theft.

#### Antenna Placement
- Place APs for optimal coverage but limit signal leakage outside the building.
- Use site surveys to minimize interference.

### 4.6 Authentication and Access Controls

#### Authentication Factors
1. **Something you know** — password, PIN.  
2. **Something you have** — smart card, token.  
3. **Something you are** — biometrics.  
4. **Somewhere you are** — geolocation.  
5. **Something you do** — behavioral (typing rhythm, gestures).

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Combines two or more factors from different categories.

#### 802.1X
- Port-based access control for wired and wireless networks.
- Uses EAP and RADIUS to authenticate devices before granting access.

#### Captive Portals
- Used for guest authentication.
- Redirects user to web page for login or acceptance.

#### MAC Filtering
- Allows or blocks devices based on their MAC address.
- Easy to spoof; not reliable as the sole security measure.

#### Certificate-Based Authentication
- Uses digital certificates to verify identity.
- Strong, tamper-proof method used in enterprises.

#### Account Lockout Policy
- Prevent brute-force attacks by locking accounts after failed attempts.
