## 2.0 Infrastructure (18% of the exam)

### 2.1 Copper Cabling
There are twisted pairs inside the cable. One of the signals will be positive and one will be negative. The twist helps to stop interference. The different pairs in the cable will have different twist rates.

**UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)** — no shielding anywhere.  
**STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)** — shielding around the whole cable or the individual pairs. Has a grounding wire.

**Abbreviations:**
- U = Unshielded  
- S = Shielded with braided shield  
- F = Foil shield (over cable shielding) / (individual pairs shielding)

Examples: UTP, STP, F/UTP, S/FTP, etc.

**Cable specs:**
- Cat 3 = 10BASE-T at 100m  
- Cat 5 = 100BASE-TX or 1000BASE-T at 100m  
- Cat 5e = 100BASE-TX or 1000BASE-T at 100m  
- Cat 6 = 10GBASE-T at 37–55m  
- Cat 6a = 10GBASE-T at 100m  
- Cat 7 = 10GBASE-T at 100m  

**Plenum cables:**  
A plenum is a shared airspace (above ceiling) used by HVAC systems. Cables inside must be fire-rated (less flexible but safer).

**Coaxial cables:**  
Used for TV and modems. Central conductor → insulation → shielding → jacket.
