## 3.0 Network Operations (17% of the exam)

### 3.1 Network Documentation

#### Operations Procedures
- Define clear procedures for normal and emergency operations.
- Include **downtime notifications**, **facility issues**, and **software upgrade schedules**.
- Maintain **change control** and **testing procedures** before deployment.

#### Network Mapping
Two main types of network maps:

1. **Logical Map** — Shows how data moves between devices and networks.
   - Displays IP subnets, VLANs, routing, firewalls.
   - Often created with tools like Visio, Lucidchart, or Gliffy.
   - Useful for understanding traffic flow.

2. **Physical Map** — Shows actual hardware layout and cabling.
   - Displays rack diagrams, switches, routers, cable connections.
   - Useful for troubleshooting and planning upgrades.

#### Change Management
The structured process of modifying network systems:
- Plan → Test → Approve → Implement → Document → Review.
- Each change should have rollback steps in case of failure.
- Helps maintain uptime and security compliance.

#### Cable Management and Labeling
- Follow **ANSI/TIA/EIA-606** standards for documentation.
- Use **unique identifiers** and **color coding**.
- Maintain a **centralized database** for labeling and port assignments.

#### System Labeling
Every device must have:
- Unique system ID or asset tag.
- Serial number and model.
- Visible physical label and entry in asset tracking software.

#### Circuit Labeling
- Record details of WAN circuits (IDs, provider info, contact numbers).
- Maintain documentation for troubleshooting and support calls.

#### Patch Panel Labeling
- Each port labeled with its endpoint or room number.
- Enables quick identification and reduces human error.

#### Baselines
- Define **normal operating conditions** for performance metrics.
- Use baselines to detect anomalies and anticipate upgrades.

#### Inventory Management
Keep an up-to-date record of all assets:
- Device type, model, serial, location, and configuration.
- Include purchase date, warranty, and ownership info.
- Barcode, RFID, or QR code tagging recommended.

Use **inventory management software** with integrated help desk and reporting.

### 3.2 Availability Concepts

#### Fault Tolerance
- Systems must continue operating after a component failure.
- Common methods:
  - **Redundancy** (duplicate hardware)
  - **Load balancing**
  - **RAID** storage
  - **Failover clusters**

#### Redundancy
- Backup components or systems that take over automatically.
- Examples: dual power supplies, RAID drives, redundant routers.

#### High Availability
- Systems that provide **continuous uptime** (99.999% or higher).
- No single point of failure.
- May require clustering, heartbeat monitoring, or automatic failover.

#### Load Balancing
- Distributes workload across multiple servers or network paths.
- Prevents overloads and increases fault tolerance.
- Can operate at Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (application).

#### NIC Teaming
- Combines multiple network interfaces on one device.
- Increases throughput and redundancy.
- Supported in most OS (bonding, link aggregation, etc.).

### 3.2 Power Management

#### UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
- Provides temporary power during blackouts or surges.
- Types:
  - Standby
  - Line-interactive
  - Online (double conversion)
- Supports graceful shutdown and avoids data loss.

#### Generators
- Long-term backup power solution using fuel.
- May power entire building or specific systems.
- Takes a few seconds to start; UPS fills the gap.

#### Dual Power Supplies
- Two independent PSUs in a server.
- If one fails, the other takes full load.

#### Hot Swappable Components
- Can be replaced without shutting down the system.
- Common for power supplies, drives, fans.

### 3.2 Backup and Recovery

#### Backup Types
- **Full Backup:** All data; resets archive bit; long to perform but fast to restore.  
- **Incremental Backup:** Only changed files since last incremental; fast backup, slow restore.  
- **Differential Backup:** Changed files since last full backup; medium for both backup and restore.  

#### Archive Bit
- Marks if a file has changed since the last backup.

#### Recovery Sites
- **Cold Site:** Empty building; slowest recovery.  
- **Warm Site:** Has space and equipment, but not fully configured.  
- **Hot Site:** Full duplicate, constantly synchronized, instant recovery.  

#### Testing Backups
- Always test restoration process to ensure data integrity and completeness.

---

### 3.3 Process Monitoring

#### Log Management
- Collect system logs via **Syslog** or **Windows Event Viewer**.
- Store on **centralized log servers**.
- Rotate logs to manage disk usage.
- Compress or archive old logs.

#### Data Graphing
- Convert raw log data into visual metrics.
- Tools: Grafana, Kibana, PRTG, SolarWinds.
- Use graphs for performance, trends, and forecasting.

#### Port Scanning
- Tools like **Nmap** identify open ports, OS, and services.
- Detect unauthorized devices or services.
- Use scripts (NSE) for deeper analysis.

#### Vulnerability Scanning
- Detect missing patches, misconfigurations, and known CVEs.
- Types:
  - **External** (internet-facing)
  - **Internal** (within LAN)
- Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys.

#### Patch Management
- Schedule regular updates (monthly or emergency).
- Track installed and pending updates.
- Maintain rollback plans for failed patches.

#### Baseline Review
- Compare system performance against normal levels.
- Identify degradation or abnormal traffic patterns.

#### Protocol Analyzers
- Capture and inspect traffic (Wireshark, tcpdump).
- Helps identify errors, retransmissions, or misconfigurations.

### 3.3 Event Management

#### Interface Monitoring
- Use SNMP or NetFlow to track interface status.
- Trigger alerts on downtime or abnormal performance.

#### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- Centralized analysis of logs from all systems.
- Provides:
  - **Correlation** of different event types.
  - **Real-time alerting.**
  - **Forensic reporting** for investigations.

#### Syslog
- Standard for message logging.
- Used to send logs from routers, firewalls, and servers to a SIEM.
- Requires large storage space for retention.

#### SIEM Dashboard
- Aggregated view of network and security data.
- Graphs, charts, and timelines for fast analysis.

#### SNMP Monitoring
- **SNMPv3** adds encryption, integrity, and authentication.
- Used for device metrics (uptime, utilization, errors).

#### Performance Metrics
- Key metrics:
  - Bandwidth utilization
  - Packet loss
  - Latency and jitter
  - Interface resets
  - CPU/memory load
- Collected with SNMP, NetFlow, or dedicated tools.

### 3.4 Remote Access

#### VPN Technologies

**IPsec (Layer 3):**
- Provides encryption and authentication at packet level.
- Ensures confidentiality and integrity.
- Common for **site-to-site VPNs**.

**SSL/TLS VPN (Layer 7):**
- Client-to-site VPNs using browsers or software clients.
- Easy to deploy; user authentication via credentials.

**DTLS VPN (Datagram TLS):**
- Uses UDP instead of TCP for real-time applications (VoIP, video).

#### Remote Desktop Access
- **RDP** (Windows), **VNC** (cross-platform), **TeamViewer**, etc.
- Enables full desktop sharing for support or remote work.
- Watch out for open RDP ports on firewalls.

#### SSH
- Encrypted console communication.
- Used for remote device configuration (routers, servers, firewalls).

#### Web-Based Management
- Managed via browser (HTTPS).
- Convenient but not all settings available.

#### File Transfers
- **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol)  
- **FTPS** (FTP over SSL)  
- **TFTP** (simple, no auth/encryption)  

#### Out-of-Band Management
- Management via separate dedicated network or modem.
- Accessible even when the main network is down.
- Adds resilience and remote troubleshooting capability.
